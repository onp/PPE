# Professional Practice Exam: Ethics & Law

Freely adapted from a ragged powerpoint slideshow printout of unknown provenance.

# Law

## Legislation

Law codified or made by the government

For example:

* The Professional Engineers Act of Ontario
* Human Rights Code
* Employment Standards Act


## Common Law

Cases (Judge-made law)

Theory of Precedent: apply legal principles established by similar or analogous situations to the current situation.

Changes slowly over time.

## The Burden of Proof

In criminal law, accusations must be proven **beyond a reasonable doubt.**

In civil law (as in common law), determinations are made based on the **balance of probabilities.**


## Limitation Periods

Limitation period means that any law suit must be commenced within a certain period of time. If a suit is started after this time has elapsed, it will automatically fail.

The 3rd edition PPE Law book is wrong, as the law changed January 1, 2004.

Now all claims (tort, contract, and professional negligence) must be commenced within 2 years of the "discovery" of the problem, and within 15 years of when the service was provided.

Principle of Discoverability: where there is a breach of the duty of care, the limitation period does not begin until the plaintiff discovers or ought reasonably to have discovered the damage.

There is an ultimate limitation of 15 years after the service or product was provided.


## Consideration

The courts do not concern themselves with the value or amount of consideration.  It is up to the parties to negotiate the price for a product or service.

Without consideration, there is only a promise to do something, not an enforceable contract.

## Seals

If a document is "sealed", this satisfies the requirement of consideration for an enforceable contract.

There are two types of seals:

* Personal Seal: red adhesive wafer.
* Mechanical Seal: imprinted with a mechanical device.

Tenders in construction contracts are often sealed (as an irrevocable offer must have consideration).

## Equitable Estoppel

Consider the following situation:

2 parties enter a contract. Under the terms of the contract, 1 party (the contractor) will perform the work, and the other party (the owner) will pay for those services.

At some point, the parties change the terms of the contract, or no longer comply with the strict terms of the contract.  Both parties act as if the terms of the contract have changed.  In fact, one party (for example, the contractor) relies on the actions of the other party (the owner) -- indicating that the terms of the contract have changed.

Then, the client party reverts back to the terms of the original contract and refuses to pay.

The court says that even though there was no consideration for the "new contract" (created by the changes to the old contract), it would be unfair to allow the party to get out of their obligation to pay.

In this case the client party is **estopped** (prevented) from relying on the strict terms of the contract.


### A Lack of Consideration

Without consideration, there is only a promise.  This not a legally binding contract.

The questions are:

1. Can one party avoid the obligations of a new contract (promise) because no consideration was exchanged?
2. Can one party enforce the strict contractual terms of the original contract?


### Case 1: Conwest Exploration

Vendor owned mining claims.  Purchaser had to take certain steps by a  specific date in order to exercise option for mining rights.  The vendor determined that the purchaser could not satisfy the conditions. The vendor implied that the time would be extended so that the other party could satisfy the conditions.  However, the promise to extend was not accompanied by consideration. Then, the vendor said that the original date must apply.

The Supreme Court of Canada decided that it was "inequitable" or unfair for the vendor to enforce the original agreement.  The purchaser relied on the vendor's time extension and, therefore, should abide by that new term of the contract.  Therefore, the vendor was estopped form reverting back to the original terms of the contract.

Key trigger for equitable estoppel: the purchaser *relied* on the new terms *implied by the other party*.


### Case 2: Owen Sound Public Library

Both parties agreed that the due date for payment to the contractor would be extended.  The owner wanted the contractor to affix a seal to the architect's certificate. Contractor undertook to obtain seal.  Payment date passed.  The contractor later tried to terminate the contract because the owner had not paid within the time required.  The Court said that the contractor's conduct led the owner to believe that the due date for payment would be extended.  Therefore, the contractor was estopped from enforcing the original terms of the contract.

Key: The owner *relied* on the new terms *agreed to by the other party*.


### Case 3: John Burrows

The plaintiff in this case was trying to enforce a promissory note.  Payments were made late and the penalties were not enforced.  In this case, if a payment was made late, then the entire principle was required to be paid.

For the principle of estoppel to apply, it would be neccesary to demonstrate that the "first" party intended that the legal relations created by the original contract would be altered as a result of the negotiations.  The fact that one party did not immediately enforce the terms of the original contract is not sufficient to change the terms of the contract.

It is important to distinguish this from the Conwest case.  In that case, the vendor had implied consent to the new arrangement, whereas in the John Burrows case, the plaintiff's silence did not constitute agreement.


## Legal Capacity

### Minors

Contracts with minors (persons who have not reached the age of majority) are enforceable only:

* by the minor
* Or, if it is a contract for necessary items such as clothing, food, lodging, or transportation
* Or, if the contract is ratified by the minor when s/he reaches age of majority (18 in Ontario)


### Capacity of Corporations

To be enforceable, the contract must be within the powers of the corporation.

For day-to-day dealings, it is possible to rely on the representatives of the corporation, so long as the acts are within the actual, usual, or apparent scope of the official's authority.


## Legality of Purpose

A Contract cannot be enforced if its purpose is unlawful or contrary to a statute.  For example: commiting a crime, avoiding payment of a debt, contracting with a non-licensed tradesperson, etc.

A Contract cannot be enforced if it is against public policy (contrary to common law). For example: a contract that contains restrictive covenants such as a non-compete clause in an employment contract.

To be enforceable, terms like a non-compete clause must restrict the party they concern no more than is necessary. Restrictions must be "reasonable" in terms of both time and geography.

If it is reasonable, then the contract will be enforceable.


## Form of a Contract

Contracts may be oral, written, or both.  

However, for a contract to be enforceable under the Statute of Frauds, it must be in writing.  This statute applies to:

* Sale of land
* Contracts to be performed beyond 1 year
* Guarantees of indebtedness (not contracts of indemnification)

Even if a contract is unenforceable because of the Statute of Frauds, it will not be void -- for example, if a buyer abandons an oral agreement for the purchase of land, a deposit made for the land under that oral contract would not be return.

## Factors affecting the formation of a contract

### Innocent misrepresentation

A false assertion made by a person who does not appreciate that the statement is false.

The deceived party must repudiate (treat as terminated) the contract within a reasonable amount of time, and will be entitled to damages for their costs sustained as a result of entering into the contract.

### Fraudulent misrepresentation

A statement made: (1) that is knowingly false; (2) without belief in its truth; or (3) recklessly, without regard for whether it is true or false.

The deceived party is entitled to rescind the contract (treat the contract as if it never happened) and claim damages for reasonable costs that they incurred as a result of entering into the contract.  They may also sue for damages for deceit or damages for negligent misrepresentation.

The right to sue for damages for negligent misrepresentation was established in the Hedley Byrne case.

### Economic Duress

When a party is forced to renegotiate the terms of a contact to their detriment, the contract is not valid and will not be enforced.

By "forced" it is meant that at the time of making the contract there are no other options available, and if the contract is not accepted the party will face severe economic losses.

**Gotaverken Case** -- A contract was established to retrofit a boiler in a pulp mill for $26 million.  The Owner had paid almost $24 million of this when problems developed ("gas-outs" affecting contractor's personnel)  that led to work interruptions, which threatened the contractor with substantial losses.  The owner compensated the contractor for the cost of the gas-outs, but the contractor threatened to reduce shifts substantially unless the contract was changed from fixed-price to time-and-materials.  The owner was under duress, as they would suffer extreme economic losses if the contractor reduced shifts and failed to complete the work.  The court held that the owner was forced into the new contract under economic duress, and thus the new contract was not enforceable.

### Mistake

Courts rarely provide relief to contracting parties if a unilateral mistake is made.  Parties are responsible for their own mistakes.  If, for example a party offers a contract that states an incorrect price, the contract can be enforced and the offeror forced to comply with the terms of the contract.

**Belle River Case** -- a contract was $70,000 lower than intended because of an error transferring a figure on a summary sheet. The contract was made under seal and irrevocable for 60 days.  The defendant contractor was trying to withdraw the offer, but was not allowed to do so by the plaintiff owner.  The Trial Judge said that a contractor may not have to comply with a contract under such circumstances.  He noted that in such a situation, an owner was likely to receive poor work or end up with a lawsuit.  The Court of Appeal said that an offeree cannot accept a contract where he knows that it has been made by mistake and the mistake affects the fundamental terms of the contract.  Because of the mistake, the contract was not the one that the offeror had intended to make, and the offeree was aware of that fact.

**Ron Engineering** -- a deposit of $150K was paid with a tender.  The tender contained a mistake: $750K was omitted, out of a total of $2.7 million.  An hour after the tenders open, the contractor informed the Water Commission (owner) of the mistake.  The trial judge ruled in favour of the Commission, saying that the contract was bound by the tender.  The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the contractor, saying that the mistake was material and important, and was immediately drawn to the attention of the Commission.  An appeal was made to the Supreme Court of Canada to decide if Ron Engineering was entitled to their $150K deposit.  The SCC ruled in favour of the Water Commission, because the tender had included an independent contract which stated that if the tender was withdrawn, then the deposit of $150K would be forfeit.  Since the ruling relied on this independent portion of the tender and not on the mistake in the contract, the SCC decision here did not impact the earlier Belle River ruling.

Traditionally, if a party made a mistake, they were responsible for it ("too bad for them"). The Belle River ruling made the intentions of the parties matter.  A contract was only enforceable if it was the contract that both of the parties *intended* to enter into.

The Ron Engineering ruling established that if there were 2 related contracts (in this case, the work contract and the tender contract) and there was a mistake in one of them, the party making the mistake is still bound by the other contract (the tendering contract) but could not be forced to comply with the contract where the mistake was made (the work contract).

The typical structure in a tendering process, based on the SCC decision in Ron Engineering, is that there will be two contracts:

* Contract A, governing the tendering process.  The owner's request constitutes offering Contract A, and the contractor submitting an irrevocable bid constitutes their acceptance of it.
* Contract B, the actual contract for construction or services

The two-contract system may limit an owner's ability to negotiate with other contractors due to the terms of Contract A.  It is therefore potentially advantageous for both parties to make Contract A as flexible as possible, providing the right to delete terms, make changes, overlook mistakes, and negotiate.  Overly aggressive or unfair terms/rights in Contract A might affect its enforceability.

**Ben Bruinsma** -- Contract A was formed by a number of contracts.  The Owner deleted an item in the tendering process, making a different bidder the new lowest bid.  The tender package (Contract A) did not say that items could be deleted, so the Owner was found to be in breach of Contract A, and the previous (prior to the deletion) lowest bidder was awarded the Contract B.

**Chinook** -- *Note that this is a British Colombia case.* The ruling found that the owner must adhere to an implied duty to accept lowest bidder unless the tender documents contained terms expressly stating that the bids would be evaluated on other criteria.  The language "the lowest tender or any tender will not necessarily be accepted" was found to be unacceptable.

**Megatech** -- *A comparable case in Ontario.* The lowest bid did not follow the tender guidelines.  The Owner was allowed to accept another bidder because the tender package said "can award the contract to the lowest bidder or any bidder".  This language is acceptable in Ontario, and therefore there was no breach of Contract.

**Kencor** -- *Another similar case, from Saskatchewan.* Language cannot be too broad or vague, for example "refuse or accept any tender, waive defects, technicalities, or accept any tenders that are considered to be in the best interest of the Province."  The terms must state the criteria on which the decision will be based.


## Contract Interpretation

Courts can interprt the meaning of a contract if there is a dispute between the parties.  The court tries to determine the most reasonable interpretation through an examination of witnesses, consideration of intent, and study of definitions.

The "liberal" approach takes into account the intent of the parties.

The "strict" approach focusses on the precise words of the agreement, so long as the contract is not unconscionable.  See the Hunter Engineering Case.

The principle of *Contra Proferenter* is generally applied: where a contract is ambiguous, it will be interpreted against the party who drafted the provision (or equivalently, in favour of the other party).


### Parol Evidence Rule

This is the principle that external oral evidence cannot be used to change the interpretation of a written contract or vary its terms.  For example, if a condition is agreed on verbally but not contained in the contract, it will not be considered part of the contract.

There are some exceptions to this. If the validity of a contract is conditional on some provision being satisfied, then oral evidence may be consulted to establish whether or not that provision was satisfied.

**Pym** -- Parties were to have shared ownership of a new machine.  The machine would have to be approved by 2 engineers before it would be purchased.  Only one of the engineers approved, and thus no contract was formed because of approval provision which the contract was conditional upon.


### Implied Terms

Where clearly reasonable, courts may imply terms into the contract.

**Moorcock** -- A boat moored at a dock was damaged when tide went out. The court decided that it was an implied term of the contract that the boat would be safe at low tide while at the dock.

The *Sale of Goods Act* provides a number of other terms that are generally implied:

* Materials and workmanship will be of proper standard and quality.
* Work will be carried out in a proper and workmanlike manner.
* When completed and installed, the object will be fit for the purpose intended.
* Work will be completed in a reasonable time and without undue delay.
* Workmanship must comply with the Building Code and/or other relevant legislation.


## Discharge of Contracts

Contracts can be considered 'discharged' for a number of reasons:

*Performance*: both parties have performed their obligations (excepting warranties)

*Agreement to Discharge*: parties can mutually agree to cancel or terminate a contract.

*Discharge Persuant to Express Terms*: discharge will occur automatically after certain events, such as bankruptcy, failure to complete work properly, or failure to comply with terms of the contract.

Additionally, it can happen due to *Frustration*, *Breach*, or *Repudiation*.


### Discharge by Frustration

A contract may be frustrated where the obligations of the parties have been radically changed by circumstances not foreseen or contemplated by the parties.

**Metropolitan Water Board** -- Had a contract to build a reservoir over the course of 6 years.  The occurrence of the war dramatically altered circumstances, requiring construction to stop.  The contract was discharged by frustration.

Often, a *Force Majeur* provision will be included in a contract.  This generally provides guidance as to how the contract will change in the event of war, riot, insurrection, flood, labour dispute, or other events beyond the control of either party.

**Davis Contractors** -- it was not considered frustration of contract when a shortage of labour delayed completion of a project. It simply placed more onerous terms on the parties.








## Format of the Law Exam

4 questions

* #1 will be a Definition question
* #2, #3, #4 will be Case questions

Short answer questions are possible, but rare.  They could be regarding "legality of purpose", "unilateral mistakes in the tendering process", or "disclaimer in tort"

Case Questions are not looking for the correct answer, number, or a yes/no decision.  Answers should demonstrate your knowledge of the legal principles.
